🥤 Fanta Multi-Flavour Website Design – May 2024

📌 Overview

On May 7, 2024, I designed a concept website project for Fanta in Figma, highlighting four unique flavours (Lemon, Orange, Grape, and one additional variant). The design focused on creating a simple, colorful, and brand-aligned layout to reflect Fanta’s playful identity.

The concept included landing page prototypes for each flavour, each with its own distinct color scheme, imagery, and interactive QR codes. The goal was to combine minimalist UI design with strong visual branding, simulating a real-world beverage marketing campaign.
